The strategy pattern allows switching out one algorithm or policy for another without modifying the client. 

Instead of directly implementing a single algorithm, the code receives runtime instructions specifying which of the group of algorithms to run.

<h2>When should you use it ? </h2>

<ul>
<li>Use the Strategy pattern when you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.</li>

<li>Use the pattern when your class has a massive conditional operator that switches between different variants of the same algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<h2> How do you implement it ? </h2>

The Strategy pattern suggests that you take a class that does something specific in a lot of different ways and extract all of these algorithms into separate classes called strategies.
