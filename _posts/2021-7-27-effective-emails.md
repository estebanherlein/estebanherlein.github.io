It may seem like an easy and simple task, but crafting a great email is an art. Here you can find some pieces of advice I would give to anyone struggling with writting effective emails.

<h2>Subject Lines are Important</h2>

You get a chance to caught the attention of the recipient when he reads your subjet, when the subject line is a tease or does not relate to the content of the email you risk losing the interlocutor attention.

<h2>Use Bullet Points and Highlight Call to Action</h2>

Bullet points make it much easier for the recipient to read the email quickly and effectively. It also helps the reader identify the main points of the email. 
<b>If the recipient is expected to do something after receiving the email, highlight the call to action.</b>

<h2>Keep it Short</h2>

No one has the time to read a 10-paragraph email, don’t sent it. If you have 10-paragraphs, or even four-paragraphs, then you’re likely including unrelated content.

<h2>Don’t Muddle Content</h2>

Stick to one content area per email. If you are sending a follow-up email to a colleague after a meeting, then it is unnecessary to add in something about a different client or information about the company picnic, etc. 

When you muddle content, it makes it much harder for the recipient to find the email in a search.

<h2>Be Collegial</h2>

Always open your email with a pleasantry. I often craft my email, then go back and add in the “I hope you had a great vacation” or “Have a great weekend – enjoy the Fall weather.”

<h2>Watch Your Tone</h2>

The tone of an email is difficult to assess, but more often than not, the reader will assign a tone, even when one was not intended, so be careful not to craft the email with tone by watching the use of exclamation marks, using inflammatory words, etc.

<h2>Avoid Quotes That Could be Offensive to Others</h2>

More and more you see quotes at the bottom of emails. Some are benign inspirational quotes, such as “Be the best you can be every day,” these are fine; however, avoid quotes with religious meaning, quotes that could be viewed as excluding others, etc. could offend a co-worker, a client, or a vendor, which could result in the loss of productivity and business.

<h2>Always Proofread Your Emails</h2>

Sending out an email with typos or misspelled words makes you look bad. Take the extra minute to proofread the email.

<h2>Never send an email when angry of frustrated</h2>

If you need to write the email, do so in a word document, where it is impossible to hit the send button by accident.

<h2>Email Chains</h2>

Email chains can be effective, but sometimes it is more effective to pick up the telephone and have a conversation in five minutes versus four hours of back and forth emails. Also, be careful not to change content areas without changing the subject line.
