A speech serves as an ideal medium when presenting information in meetings.

A great speech must take into consideration 10 things:

<h3>A Clear Message</h3>

A speech should be clear and unambiguous so that the audience can understand it easily. If it is not clear enough to express its meaning to the audience, it will become ineffective.

<h3>Definiteness of Message</h3>

The message of the speech should be definite and relevant to the subject matter.

<h3>It Must Be Concise</h3>

The audience becomes impatient with a long speech. Hence, speech should be as concise as possible. However, it should not be incomplete.

<h3>Give It An Informal Touch</h3>

Though a speech is a formal address, it should be presented in a personal and informal way.

<h3>Consider the Audience</h3>

A speech is delivered to a specific audience. So the speaker should actively consider the expectations, interest, and nature of the audience.

<h3>Speak Slowly</h3>

An ideal speech is one that is delivered slowly and in the usual tone. It helps the audience to hear and understand the message clearly.

<h3>It Must Be Free from Emotions</h3>

Another important feature of a good speech is that it should be delivered in an unbiased and unemotional way. Speakerâ€™s emotion may drive him away from the main theme.

<h3>Use Body Language</h3>

Good Speech goes with necessary body language. Therefore, at the time of delivering a speech, the speaker should use various nonverbal cues.
