The increasingly digital world makes it easier for hackers to intercept corporate information and user conversations. However, it also presents opportunities for organizations to prevent attackersâ€™ malicious intent. Common methods that help prevent eavesdropping attacks include: 

<ul>
<li><strong>Military-grade encryption:</strong><br> One of the best ways to prevent eavesdropping attacks is to encrypt data in transmission and private conversations. Encryption blocks attackers' ability to read data exchanged between two parties. For example, military-grade encryption provides 256-bit encryption, which is near impossible for an attacker to decode.</li>
<li><strong>Spread awareness:</strong><br> Ensuring that employees are aware of the risks and dangers of cybersecurity is a crucial first line in protecting organizations from any cyberattack. This is very much the case with eavesdropping attacks, so organizations must provide training that advises users about how attackers go about launching the attacks. Employees need to understand the methods attackers use to listen in to conversations, follow best practices to limit the risk, and be constantly aware of the signs of an attack. They should also avoid downloading insecure applications or software and never connect to weak or open networks.</li>
<li><strong>Network segmentation:</strong><br> Organizations can limit the possibilities of attackers eavesdropping on networks by restricting their availability. Network segmentation enables organizations to limit resources to only the people that require access to them. For example, people on a marketing team do not require access to HR systems and people on the IT team do not need view to financial information. Network segmentation divides the network up, which decongests traffic, prevents unwanted activity, and improves security by preventing unauthorized access.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid shady links:</strong><br> Related to spreading awareness is the need to avoid shady or untrusted links. Eavesdropping attackers can spread malicious software that includes eavesdropping malware through shady links. Users should only download official software from trusted resources and providers, and only download applications from official app stores.</li>
<li><strong>Update and patch software:</strong><br> Attackers can also exploit vulnerabilities in software to target organizations and users. This makes it crucial to turn on automatic updates and ensure all software is patched immediately as a new release or update is available.</li>
<li><strong>Physical security:</strong><br> Organizations can also protect their data and users through physical security measures in their office spaces. This is crucial to protecting the office from unauthorized people who may drop physical bugs on desks, phones, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Shielding:</strong><br> The risk of eavesdropping through computer radiation can be prevented by installing security measures and shielding. For example, TEMPEST-protected computers enable organizations to block unintended radiation and keep their data and users secure.</li>
</ul>
