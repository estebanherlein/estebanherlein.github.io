Remote learning is the process of teaching and learning performed at a distance. 

Rather than having students and teachers coming together in person, remote learning means that students are distanced from their teacher and their peers.

The most effective remote learning attempts to mirror the classroom environment virtually, as much as that’s possible when the student and teacher are in two different places.

<h2>What does asynchronous / synchronous remote learning mean?</h2>

Though there are many ways that remote learning can take place, the best experiences occur when teachers combine synchronous learning opportunities that replicate the classroom with asynchronous opportunities that promote independent study.

For synchronous experiences, where students learn together at the same time, technology is required. In addition, meeting platforms like Zoom or Google Meet allow classes to gather and collaborate.

For asynchronous experiences, where students learn on a more individual schedule, a learning management system allows for the organization of learning opportunities from a distance. 

It’s also a portal for students and teachers to interact and communicate when they’re not “in class.” Furthermore, teachers can keep track of their students’ progress and offer feedback.

<h2>What’s the difference between remote, online, and distance learning?</h2>

Currently, there is debate about the difference between remote, online, and distance learning. 

Some educators equate “remote” and “distance” learning as both being performed away from the school and classroom. 

But other educators distinguish the terms by emphasizing that “remote” learning has emerged as an emergency intervention as a result of the coronavirus, while distance learning is more thoughtfully and proactively planned out.


Online learning, on the other hand, is different. 

It offers a course of study online without trying to replicate the face-to-face classroom experience. 

For that reason, online courses are designed over several months to offer students a series of learning engagements that are tailored to an entirely online environment. 

Rather than providing traditional lectures, or a sequence of assignments to complete, online learning includes a variety of modalities that guide students through content modules. 

Special attention is paid to eliciting emotion and motivation in students and being intentional in encouraging students to apply their knowledge frequently.
