Learners are expected to do much of their learning virtually or at a distance from one another in face-to-face classes.

This is an scenario that calls for greater learner autonomy. But it needs to come from within, though; it isn’t something teachers can impose on students.

Here are some ways that we can create the conditions for promoting learner autonomy.

<h2>Set a learning path</h2>

With every unit of instruction, start with a simple goal-setting task using ‘can-do’ statements. 

For each learning outcome, have learners indicate which they can do, need to do, and want to learn. 

<b>Identifying those areas they most need and want to learn about allows them to prioritise those elements in a lesson.</b>

<h2>1-2-3 Then Me</h2>

This approach requires students to draw on their own and their peers' understanding of an assignment first. Give students one minute to read the directions silently, two minutes to discuss the directions with each other, and three minutes to plan their approach to the task. 

Only then can they ask for help. Or give a one-minute explanation of the directions to the entire class.

<h2>Resource Files</h2>

Another self-help mechanism when the teacher is not available. These files contain troubleshooting tips for routines and tools that students use regularly. 

For example, what to do when the devices' screen freezes or how to overcome writer's block. Resource files can include additional graphic organizers, paired editing protocols, and topics. Files can be physical (i.e. folders with paper inside) and placed in a prominent area of the room, or digital files in a clearly identified and easily accessible location on a device . 

<h2>Become the Guide on the Side</h2>

The first thing to consider is that for our students to become more autonomous we first need to make sure we, as teachers, are prepared to relinquish control and give students responsibility. 

It might be easier said than done, but it is key to the process. We need to provide the conditions in which they can be autonomous in the first instance. 

A simple way of doing this is adjusting the way in which we teach, moving away from a deductive to a more inductive approach when it comes to teaching grammar, vocabulary and writing. So instead of standing at the front of the class and giving a wonderfully detailed and thorough grammar presentation, let the students work out rules and uses for themselves from example sentences.

For example, hand out a list of 20 if sentences and ask them to work together, discuss and work out the rules. Or, write some sentences on the board (all using your target grammar), but with the words mixed up and then hand the board pen to the students and leave the room.

Alternatively, use a more guided discovery approach by giving them a few example sentences and prompt them with the necessary questions to work out the rules by themselves. 

<h2>Give Them Choice</h2>

Think about a time when, as a student, you were given a choice. Now try to remember the results of that. 

If your experiences were anything like mine then the results were overwhelmingly positive, with students sometimes actually going over and above what they were asked to do. Not only is giving students choice a motivating factor for many of them, it’s also a central feature in supporting their autonomy.
