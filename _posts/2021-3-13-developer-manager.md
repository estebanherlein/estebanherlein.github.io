A software development manager plans, directs, and coordinates all activities related to writing software programs.

He must be familiar with all the policies, procedures and technical issues related to software programming.

The software development manager is the “go to” man when it comes to software developers. He is also in charge of managing the activities of the software developing team of a company or specific project.

<ul>

<h2>Education and Training Requirements</h2>

Employers prefer managers who have gained much experience in the industry as the job requires extensive training.

Software mangers usually have gained their position through company loyalty from being software developers of the same company. 

With this kind of loyalty, the employer is assured of the capabilities of the manger as well as the assurance that the manager is familiar with the processes and procedures of the company’s software development unit.

A successful software development manager must have excellent interpersonal, written and verbal communication skills.

He must also be familiar with a variety of programming languages, codes and processes. 

He must possess exceptional troubleshooting skills and be able to assess quickly complex programming applications. Technology may require software development managers to keep up to date with the latest development software.
