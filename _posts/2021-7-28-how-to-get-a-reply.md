Get your emails opened, read and responded every time.

<h2>Don't waste the subject line</h2>

The subject line is your first (and sometimes last) chance to get someone to open your email. If they don't know you personally, they'll just assume your email is spam and delete it.

The best subject line sums up what your email is about. Here are some good examples:
<ul>
<li>Question about the Tuesday meeting</li>
<li>Need help with the new software</li>
<li>Do you know Jim Smith?</li>
<li>Useful feedback on the New York conference</li>
</ul>
<b>Remember that subject lines get cut off, especially on mobile. So, keep it short, interesting and to the point. </b>

<h2>Add a sense of urgency</h2>

Another tip for getting opened is adding a sense of urgency to the subject line. Using caps lock is great for this, but use it sparingly. 
Here are some examples:
<ul>
<li>I need your spreadsheet ASAP</li>
<li>URGENT: Have you voted yet?</li>
<li>ATTN: Need help in meeting room</li>
<li>RSVP: Need your answer by EOD</li>
<li>TIMELY: Sign up by 6 p.m. today</li>
</ul>

<b>When overused, these prepends quickly lose their draw.</b>

<h2>Be casual and use names  </h2>

If you're emailing someone who doesn't know you, be sure to always open with the person's name. This makes an email feel less spammy and more personal. 

This type of email feels personal and casual, but not invasive. Saying hi, using their first name and mentioning something personal and specific to the recipient can take the email to that casual place without overstepping. 

<b>Even in more formal emails, starting with a compliment or positive personal experience can immediately get the reader invested in your email and more willing to respond. Just keep it short. </b>

<h2>Get to the point</h2>

Think about how you check and prioritize your inbox. Chances are, you skim through many emails to identify what needs an immediate response, and what can be delayed. 

Don't waste time with preambles. Get to the point immediately, then add in any explainer or side information afterward. 

<b>Nobody has time to wade through an email to figure out what the heck you want.</b>

When appropriate, a bulleted list can help the reader quickly understand what you need. 

<h2>Keep it short</h2>

Even if you get to the point right away, don't ramble on afterwards. Only include the most important information, then stop typing.

Seriously. A long block of text will just make your recipients sigh and decide they'll come back and read your email later when they have more time.

<b>Your email will quickly be forgotten and they'll never get back to you. </b>

<h2>Add a call-to-action</h2>

If you want a recipient to act, say so. Give them directions on exactly what you need, like a response by a certain time and date. 

<h2>Make it easy</h2>

Make sure it is as easy as possible for your recipient to do what you ask. Add a link to click on, a phone number to call or a document to read over if you need more than just an emailed reply.

<h2> Follow up</h2>

After your deadline has passed, don't be afraid to email the recipient to check on their response. Sometimes people intend to answer you, but they just forget.
