Being a leader is tiring and demanding. You’ve got so many pieces moving around at the same time. You’ve got deadlines to meet, you’ve got clients to attend, you’ve got resources to track, and most importantly, you’ve got a team that needs to be managed and motivated properly to ensure success in the given venture.

It is overwhelming. Agreed. But there are ways to make team management much simpler and more rewarding. 

<h2>Hire the Right People</h2>

Finding the right team members for your team is difficult, but it’s also crucial.

Having the right talent in your team helps you keep your project’s productivity at its highest level. You can use the initial interview sessions to get to know potential candidates one-on-one to learn more about their talents, skills, and strengths. 

On top of that you can use the gathered intel to make informed decisions when adjusting positions and responsibilities.

<h2>Set Achievable Goals</h2>

Effective goal-setting should be a crucial part of your team management strategy. Everyone on your team should clearly understand what they are striving for daily. 

Keep in mind that without clear, concise goals (short-term and long-term), your team is very likely to miss deadlines. Try to set goals as a team with a lot of discussion and brainstorming. Include every individual in the process to confirm you are all on the same page.

<h2>Establish a Team Mission</h2>

Having a good team management strategy is a complete waste is your team doesn’t even feel like a team at all. 

So, before you assign roles and goals to your team, establish a team mission that brings everyone together. Open up constructive discussion within the team and encourage everyone on the team to provide insight or suggestions to each other. 

<h2>Delegate Tasks Effectively</h2>

It’s easy for a team to fall by the wayside when tasks and responsibilities are not assigned responsibly. 

With multiple people working on the same project, you have to ensure that you delegate the right roles and responsibilities to the right person. 

As a part of your team management strategy, you must ensure that each member of the team has a workload that fits their skills and strengths and keeps them engaged.

<h2>Maintain Open Communication</h2>

Keeping communication channels wide open is important to the success of any business. 

It can help your team be aware of every aspect of the project and discuss details with one another via one-to-one/group chat and discussion topics. These collaborative mindset allow you, your team, and your project to run smoothly and avoid deadlines from being missed.

<h2>Manage Time Wisely</h2>

Every individual, a manager or a team member, tend to feel like there are never enough hours in the day, making effective time management a matter of great importance. 

Avoid time-wasting activities like too many meetings, too much social media use, too many phone calls, etc should be a part of your team management plan.

Keep your team’s priorities in check so that they can keep their productivity and performance in check.

<h2>Provide Feedback More Often</h2>

Hiring the right talent isn’t enough to make effective team management a reality. You have to keep them motivated at all times. 

Providing sincere praise is one of the best ways to keep motivation and drive up for your team members. Conduct more frequent and constructive performance reviews. 

Also, give your team members a chance to provide you with feedback on your leadership tactics to ensure you are doing all that is necessary as a manager.Take their feedback into consideration with a positive mindset.

<h2>Resolve Team Issue ASAP</h2>

Teams are expected to work together. Unfortunately, there are often times when teams disagree on things, which can even lead to workplace conflicts.

That’s what makes conflict resolution an important aspect of your job as a manager. You have to understand the fact that workplace issues and conflicts don’t always work themselves out, so you need to step in and help those involved find a solution or reach a compromise right away.

<h2>Cheer on Your Team</h2>

As the team manager, you are your team’s biggest cheerleader. 

You are the one who should make the team feel appreciated for all of the hard work they do. 

You should ensure they get that sense of accomplishment that they need to bring out the best version of themselves in the workplace. 

So, as a part of your team management strategy, keep motivating your team with short pep talks every now and then or hold one-on-one encouragement sessions every 2 months.
