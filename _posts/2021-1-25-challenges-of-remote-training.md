<h2>Lack of face-to-face supervision </h2>

The lack of face-to-face interaction is a commonly cited issue relating to remote working in general, but it can be a pain point for remote training, particularly if the switch has recently been made from classroom-based models.

Employee training in many cases is still seen by staff as a compulsory box to tick and their attention cannot be 100% guaranteed. 

Trainers worry that learners will not study as hard without in-person supervision. 

Many learners, on the other hand, struggle with reduced access to “over the shoulder” instructor support and communication. 

<h2>Lack of access to information</h2>

Newly remote workers are often unpleasantly surprised by the increased time and effort needed to locate information from coworkers and others. 

Even getting answers to what seem like simple questions can feel like a large obstacle to a worker based at home.

Framed in the context of remote training, this often translates to information about how to access the training, how to ask questions, and how it all works. 

Essentially, remote employees need to know the WHAT, WHEN, WHY, and HOW of any remote training you want them to take well before the scheduled session takes place. They also need to know how to get help if they need it – both before and during online training sessions. 

<b>Lack of access to this information is setting your training up to fail.</b>


<h2>Social isolation</h2>

Feelings of isolation are one of the most common complaints about remote work, with employees missing the informal social interactions of a workspace setting. 

Fortunately, this is one area where online virtual training sessions can actually help if they are run correctly. 

Participation in group training can relieve these feelings and a well-run session will incorporate active engagement, collaboration, and time for questions.

If remote training doesn’t include group training sessions where people have an ability to communicate, isolation can cause any employee to feel less engaged and not “belonging” to their organization. 

So you need to ensure that your remote training sessions encourage interaction and inclusivity.


<h2>Distractions</h2>

It’s sad to say, but effective virtual work is a far cry from the way it’s often presented in the media as someone tapping away at their laptop on a beach while sipping a cocktail. 

Employers typically must ensure that their remote workers have both a dedicated, quiet workspace and adequate childcare before allowing them to work remotely. 

Remote training is even less forgiving of distractions – it may be virtual but ultimately it is a training session – and 100% focus is not just nice to have, it’s a necessity. 
So it’s imperative that even if the rest of the day is open to distractions, your 1-hour training slot is non-negotiable.

<h2>Technical challenges</h2>

It’s possible for training sessions to be interrupted by technical issues even in purpose-designed classrooms with organizational infrastructure, so imagine how much more likely this is to happen when you attempt to run a remote session. 

A great number of things can go wrong – from unstable internet and VPN connections to software and platform issues to training environment access.

There is no way to guarantee that you won’t experience technical issues when you run a remote training session, but there is much you can do to minimize the likelihood of issues occurring.
