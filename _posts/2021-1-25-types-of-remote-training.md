When we use the term ‘remote training’, most people’s first thought is something similar to an online meeting. 

That is definitely a popular model, but it’s not the only one available to you. 


<h2>Synchronous learning</h2>

Synchronous learning is any training activity in which all learners are participating simultaneously. It can happen either online or offline; so it’s likely that instructor-led classes fall into this category. 

This type of learning is time-dependent – there is a single time slot in which it can happen. 

You, as a facilitator, need to carefully plan your teaching sessions and make sure they are announced in good time. 

At the same time, your learners may need to book a specific time slot in the schedule to virtually attend.

<h2>Asynchronous learning</h2>

This model, in contrast, happens when learners access learning content, assessments, and communicate and participate in activities in their own time – or ‘self-paced’. 

They don’t need to be on site, and for remote training, they don’t even need to be in the same online learning space at the same time to study and complete the training. 

Asynchronous learning can also be run instructor free, as with most eLearning and video-based training, or the instructor can be involved to review assessments or as a contact resource to answer questions online. 

This type of model often demands the training results – in the form of a course completion status, score, or assessment – are provided before a certain deadline.

<h2>Blended learning</h2>

Blended learning can take elements from both the synchronous and asynchronous models and mix them together to create a custom solution. 

Because of its flexibility, a blended solution may be the best way to approach more complex remote training requirements. 

For example, it could incorporate an eLearning module and a virtual classroom session all scheduled through an Learning Management System.
