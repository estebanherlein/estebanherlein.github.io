Over the past few months, I‚Äôve been experimenting with tiny, focused tools to remove friction from my workflow and decision-making as a founder, engineer, and manager.

These experiments led me to build a Tiny Tools repository‚Äîa collection of small, single-purpose tools that solve real, everyday problems without the overhead of bloated apps or endless configuration.

<h3>Why Tiny Tools?</h3>

We often rely on heavy tools to track priorities, calculate CAC, plan sprints, or run meetings. But the truth is:

<ul><li>Most days, you just need a quick, focused solution.</li>
<li>One that lets you act now, not ‚Äúset up a system.‚Äù</li>
<li>One that respects your cognitive energy.</li></ul>

Tiny tools do exactly that.

<h3>What‚Äôs Inside?</h3>

A few examples:

<ul><li>Meeting Timer Nudger: Keeps meetings on track with gentle, structured timeboxing.</li>
<li>Value vs Effort Plotter: Visualize what‚Äôs worth doing next.</li>
<li>Interview Streamliner: Run consistent, fair interviews without cognitive overload.</li>
<li>Cash Flow Visualizer: See your burn and runway, instantly.</li>
<li>Decision Matrix Builder: Prioritize features or projects objectively, without spreadsheet chaos.</li>
<li>Small Wins Logger: Capture and reflect on your wins to fuel motivation.</li></ul>

‚Ä¶and more, all designed to be frictionless and immediately useful.

<h3>What Changed for Me</h3>

<ol><li>Focus without friction: I spend less time switching tools and more time acting.</li>
<li>Consistency in processes: Meetings, interviews, and planning run smoother.</li>
<li>Clarity in decisions: Visualizing trade-offs helps align teams faster.</li>
<li>Momentum: Small wins build confidence, helping me and my teams sustain progress.</li></ol>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>

Productivity doesn‚Äôt always require yet another system.

Sometimes, it‚Äôs about having the right small lever at the right time to move forward.

These tiny tools are my levers‚Äîand they might be yours too.

<h3>Want to Try Them?</h3>

If you‚Äôre a founder, manager, or builder who wants to reduce friction while keeping momentum:

üëâ Check out the repo: [Link to github](https://github.com/estebanherlein/TinyTools)

üëâ Try live demos: <b>Every tool is a stand-alone html file, you can download them or you can find URLs to live demos in the readme files inside the repository.</b>

If you find them useful or have ideas for additional tools, I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback.

Let‚Äôs keep workflows simple and purposeful, one tiny tool at a time.
