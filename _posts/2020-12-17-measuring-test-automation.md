Many automation projects fail due to unrealistic expectations.


To avoid this you shoul identify expectations early and communicate them to  the entire team.

Reaping the benefits of  test automation does not happen  overnight and it really helps if  everyone understands the end goal and  how to measure the progress towards it.



<h1>Benefits of test automation and how to measure them</h1>

<h2>Regression testing execution time</h2>

One key benefit of test automation is the reduced time it takes to execute regression testing.

Before starting your test automation initiative take note of how long it  takes to execute regression manually.

As  your test automation matures you should  see that regression testing takes a lot  less time to run however when you first  begin automating tests you won't have  much covered and there will be quite a  bit of time spent learning the hard  lessons of automating tests properly and  updating your suite to be more robust.

Know that this will eventually pay off  as you see hundreds of regression tests  run in minutes as opposed to weeks so  ensure that the addition of tests is not  necessarily added to the overall execution  time.

You can even set an SLA for the max  amount of time the entire suite of  automated tests can take to execute this  will force your engineers to explore  smarter options to make tests faster and  give you a measurement that you can  track another return on your investment.


<h2>Fast and Frequent Feedback</h2>

Through fast and frequent feedback ,wich you can harvest from automating your regression tests, the team is able to receive feedback as often as  needed.  The improvement of this is something you  can track as part of the progress of  your initiative, perhaps you're only able to run the tesSt and gather results once  every few days initially, because of the  manual intervention required. 

Eventually  you should be able to run the test automatically any time a developer checks in code; the faster the feedback  the less expensive it is to resolve any  issues found.


<h2> Trust over tests</h2>

This is indeed a great return on investment monitor, your team's level of  trust in the automated test:

Do they  believe that a failed test actually  means that there is a problem? 

It is a question that you can survey your team on during regular retrospectives.

This is  an important return on investment  because it allows your developers to  move a lot faster knowing that they have  the test to keep them from messing up  too badly.

This improved health of the suite also means you should see a reduction in the time spent triaging brittle tests.


<h2> Test every environment </h2>

The ability to scale  automated tests to run across different environments, browsers and devices it's certainly a valuable return on  investment. If this is something that is  important to your business strategy,  track the ability of your tests to do  this.


This may be painful at first and  you may only be able to tackle one of  these at a time but it's certainly  something you can measure the progress  toward.
