Being a great boss means helping to boost employee productivity and job satisfaction through effective management. 

Good management techniques involve creating a supportive atmosphere where employees have autonomy and are motivated to excel.

Six different management styles can be identified which were popularized in Daniel Goleman’s best selling book Emotional Intelligence.

Their research states that the most effective leaders use four management styles, typically in combination. Some styles are more productive than others depending on the situation.

<h2>Most effective</h2>

<h3>The Authoritative Style</h3>

The most effective management style, the authoritative leader is a “firm but fair” visionary who gives their employees clear, long-term direction. This approach works in most work environments, especially when the business lacks direction.

<h3>The Affiliative Style</h3>

The goal of this type of manager is to create harmony between employees, keeping everyone happy. This style is especially good to pull out of your management toolbox when you’re building a team, need to boost morale, or foster better communication.

<h3>The Democratic Style</h3>

This participative style aims to build consensus and commitment in the group. Perhaps most effective with more experienced employees, the democratic style can contribute to high morale, and the feeling that everyone has a stake in the business’s success.

<h3>The Coaching Style</h3>

A highly effective management style, the coaching style’s main objective is to foster long-term professional development in their employees. This style works best with motivated employees who want to grow. It’s challenging when the manager is less experienced and may be less effective with employees who are poor performers.

<h2>Least effective</h2>

<h3>The Coercive Style</h3>

This extremely controlling management style demands employees do what the boss tells them to. Employees don’t learn much from this approach and can become frustrated not having autonomy. It should generally be avoided, though it is effective when there’s a legitimate crisis.

<h3>The Pacesetting Style</h3>

This management style should be used sparingly at most, and if used, should only be deployed alongside other styles from the top section. The goal of this style is to complete tasks to a very high standard. 

The pacesetting manager takes on many tasks themselves so they can exert greater control over results and expects employees to follow their lead. It can create a toxic work environment and low morale.
