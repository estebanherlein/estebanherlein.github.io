> “ The Tao is not difficult
for those who have no preferences.
When love and hate are both absent,
everything becomes clear and undisguised.
Make the smallest distinction, however,
and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart.
If you wish to see the truth,
then hold no opinions for, or against, anything.
To set up what you like
against what you dislike
is the disease of the mind. ”

> Hsin Hsin Ming
