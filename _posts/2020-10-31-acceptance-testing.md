A level of software testing where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.


<h1>How are them done?</h1>


The acceptance test suite is run using predefined acceptance test procedures to direct the testers which data to use, the step-by-step processes to follow and the expected result following execution. 

The actual results are retained for comparison with the expected results.

If the actual results match the expected results for each test case, the test case is said to pass.

If the quantity of non-passing test cases does not breach the project's predetermined threshold, the test suite is said to pass. 
 
If it does, the system may either be rejected or accepted on conditions previously agreed between the sponsor and the manufacturer.

The anticipated result of a successful test execution:

<ol>

<li>test cases are executed, using predetermined data</li>
<li>actual results are recorded</li>
<li>actual and expected results are compared, and</li>
<li>test results are determined.</li>
	
</ol>

<h1>Purpose</h1>

The objective is to provide confidence that the developed product meets both the functional and non-functional requirements.


The purpose of conducting acceptance testing is that once completed, and provided the acceptance criteria are met, it is expected the sponsors will sign-off on the product development/enhancement as satisfying the defined requirements (previously agreed between business and product provider/developer). 

<h2>Types</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>Alpha Testing </b><br>
Normally takes place in the development environment and is usually done by internal staff, Long before the product is even released to external testers or customers.
<br>
Potential user groups might conduct Alpha Tests, but the important thing here is that it takes place in the development environment.
<br>
Based on the feedback – collected from the alpha testers – development teams fix certain issues and improve the usability of the product.</li>

<li><b>Beta Testing</b><br>
Also known as “field testing”, takes place in the customer’s environment and involves some extensive testing by a group of customers who use the system in their environment. 
<br>
These beta testers provide feedback, which in turn leads to improvements of the product.

</ul>
