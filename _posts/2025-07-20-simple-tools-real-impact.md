I’ve always enjoyed creating practical solutions that help people work better. After years in QA and software development, I realized many problems teams face don’t need complex systems — they need simple, effective tools that remove friction.

As I pursue my MBA, I’m learning how to align technical decisions with business strategy, and I see even more clearly the value of building focused, easy-to-adopt solutions that empower teams.

This blog will share:

<ol><li>Simple tools I’m building.</li>
<li>Lessons from my MBA applied to real workflows.</li>
<li>Thoughts on how tech can remain practical while driving impact.</li></ol>
